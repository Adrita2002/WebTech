    <div class="para"><div class="paragraph">
        <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.</p></div>

    </div>
    <h2 class="heading">How it Spreads?</h2>
    <div class="para">
        <div class="paragraph">
       <p> The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.</p><br>
        <p>You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors and in crowded settings.</p>

    <h2 class="heading">Symptomatic vs Asymptomatic</h2>
    <div class="para">
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Both terms refer to people who do not have symptoms. The difference is that ‘asymptomatic’ refers to people who are infected but never develop any symptoms, while ‘pre-symptomatic’ refers to infected people who have not yet developed symptoms but go on to develop symptoms later. </p></div>

    <div class="para"><div class="paragraph">
        There are many things you can do to keep yourself and your loved ones safe from COVID-19.
        <ul>
        <li>Check to see what national, regional and local authorities are advising so you have the most relevant information for where you are.</li>
        <li>Stay at least 1 metre away from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick, since people can have the virus without having symptoms.</li>
        <li>Wear a well-fitting three-layer mask. Clean your hands before putting on and taking off a mask.</li>
        <li>Avoid crowded places, poorly ventilated, indoor locations and avoid prolonged contact with others. Spend more time outdoors than indoors.
        <li>Open windows when indoors to increase the amount of outdoor air.</li>
        <li>Avoid touching surfaces, especially in public settings or health facilities, in case people infected with COVID-19 have touched them. Clean surfaces regularly with standard disinfectants.</li>
        <li>Frequently clean your hands with soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub. If you can, carry alcohol-based rub with you and use it often.</li>
        <li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with a bent elbow or tissue, throwing used tissues into a closed bin right away. Then wash your hands or use an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
       <li> Get vaccinated: It is extremely important now that everybody gets their two shots of vaccination. In order to register yourself for vaccination slot, visit the following sites:<br>
        <br><ul>
        <li><a class="sites" href="https://www.aarogyasetu.gov.in/">Aarogya Setu Website</a></li>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Students from premium engineering colleges including the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the National Institutes of Technology (NITs), and IITs have been demanding reopening of colleges as Covid cases across the country are on a decline.</p>
            <br>
         <p> Worried about the future, a section of students has taken to social media platforms to express their disappointment with the manner in which colleges and departments have shifted to online classes. The students have been trending hashtags like #ReopenIIT, #ReopenNIT and #ReopenEngineeringColleges.</p>
          <br>
         <p> Several students demand that engineering colleges and departments should also reopen in offline mode as everything in the country is unlocked. They also claim that due to online classes they are facing learning loss, especially in the practical courses which need hands-on training. </p><br>
        <p>Students and employees will expect assurances of safety before returning to work. Hence we are conducting a survey to analyse the present covid situation in the student demography and also get a glimpse of their views.</p></div>
