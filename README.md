## Theme
Tracking and tracing - and preventing global disease spread. Manage, collect and analyse comprehensive data to allow for real-time tracking. As economies reopen, the need for effective detection, containment, and tracing of infections is becoming the responsibility of the Institutions. Students and employees will expect assurances of safety before returning to work.
 
## Our Solution
The COVID-19 pandemic has had huge affect on the education systemm. As the situation has been improving since the last few months, we are conducting a survey to analyse the present covid situation in the student demography and also get a glimpse of their views.

 We have collected and analysed comprehensive data to allow for real-time tracking of covid cases and vaccination numbers in the country. Detailed statewise analysis has been provided along with a graphical representation of the real time data.
